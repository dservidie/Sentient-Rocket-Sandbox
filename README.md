# Sentient Rockets Sandbox

Improoved version of SmartRockets. Adding sensors to the rocket to make them able to sense its environment and react accordingly.

## Description

Rockets dont use a fixed set of commands anymore. Instead thery will use a command lambda sets of functions that will be stored in its DNA array and control its behavior. The most successful rockets will be able to pass its genes to the next generation of rockets. A mutation in some genes, gives opportunities to improve performance, and in that case, pass those genes.

## Rocket controls

Rockets dna includes instructions of main thrust power, and steering.

If you want to test manually the rockets control parameters to understand the physics you can do it in this codepen:
